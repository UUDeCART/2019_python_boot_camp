    "As our previous notebook explored, there are lots of available programming languages. Within the faculty for this course each of the following languages is the primary programming language for at least one of the faculty or teaching assistants\n",

    "\"Data science\" can be done with any of these languages (and many others), but probably the most buzz currently is around Python and R. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses. \n",

    "\n",
    ">Python has become the most popular language for majors at the top computer science departments (Philip Guo, \"Python is Now the Most Popular Introductory Teaching Language at Top U.S. Universities\"). Motivations for Python as the first language are its simple semantics and syntax [Stefik2013], leading to students making fewer mistakes, feeling more confidence, and having a better grasp of programming concepts relative to peers taught with more traditional, lower-level languages such as C or Java [Koulouri2014].... Since Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, it offer great pedagogical flexibility....Python is also an active language with many open source projects and employers looking for Python programmers (\"Is Python Becoming the King of the Data Science Forest?\", \"The RedMonk Programming Language Rankings: January 2015\").\n",
