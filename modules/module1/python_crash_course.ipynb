    "The Greek philosopher Pythagoras reportedly said, \"All is number!\". Deep down in the computer, Pythagoras is correct but in this course we are primarily going to think of data as consisting of **strings** and **numbers**. Adopting a physical metaphor, we can say that numbers and strings are our atoms of data. We can then combine numbers and strings to create molecules of data.\n",

    "Computer programs read, manipulate, and output data using **functions** which are either native to the programming language or created by a programmer.\n",

    "## What is a Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"any of a group of related actions contributing to a larger action; especially : the normal and specific contribution of a bodily part to the economy of a living organism\" \n",
    "* \"a computer subroutine; specifically : one that performs a calculation with variables provided by a program and supplies the program with a single result\"([Merriam-Webster Dictionary](http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwdictadu?book=Dictionary&va=functionless))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually we will learn how to define our own functions, but for now we will spend some time getting familiar with using the functions that are already defined in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a handle on what a function is in Python, let's look at some example functions from \"high school\" mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y = f(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "we would read this as \"$y$ is equal to a function $f$ which has an argument $x$.\" $f$ is a symbol for \"some function\", the argument $x$ might be called the *independent variable*, and $y$ might be called the the *dependent variable*. Familiar, \"school mathematics\" examples of functions might include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "y = \\sqrt{x},\\\\\n",
    "y = mx+b.\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, we take a value $x$ and returns a new value that we are assigning to the variable $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take $x$ as input and return the square root of $x$ as output. \n",
    "1. Take $x$ as input and return $x$ multiplied by $m$ plus $b$. We can generalize this pattern with the following \"definition\":\n",

    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment in a Python script is the pound symbol (``#``) and everything that follows it on a line. Once Python encounters a ``#``, it ignores everything that follows. Comments are important for us on the human end of the program. They help us understand what the programmer (perhaps us) was thinking or trying to do when the code was written.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have focused on two types of data: numbers and strings. Technically, a string is an example of a Python data structure: a collection of basic data (atoms), in this case, a character. But since Python does not have a single character data type, strings end up being a bit of a hybrid. Other data structures that come with Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list)\n",
    "* [tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)\n",
    "* [sets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset)\n",
    "* [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, lists are the work horse and dictionaries are the most powerful of the Python data structures. Since we will run across each of these data structures as we work with third-party data structures (e.g. Numpy arrays and Pandas DataFrames), we will quickly go over the syntax and basic nature of each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like strings, lists are **ordered**: there is a first, second, third, etc. elements in the list.\n",
    "* Lists are **heterogeneous**: I can have a variety of types of objects in a given list.\n",
    "* lists are **mutable**: lists can change; I can add, delete, and modify elements of the list\n",
    "* Like strings, lists are indexed with square brackets\n",
    "* Lists are defined with square brackets:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "this_is_a_list = [1, \"one\", [1,2]]\n",

    "\n",
    "* Dictionaries are **unordered**\n",
    "* Dictionaries are **heterogeneous**\n",
    "* Dictionaries can be \"indexed\" with the **keys**\n",
    "* Dictionaries are defined with curly brackets surrounding key-value pairs\n",
